# A simple C# Application

The purpose of this application is to give me a reason to explore with OOP structure and a showcase as well of my knowledge with .NET framework

## Overview

I've create this application for a college client. If you want to fully explore the application. There is a .bak file included in the root folder. You could load that into your local MSSQL Database and start the application.
